This is a personal project with the intention of making a complete beautiful and stylish Sudoku game. 
The app is currently on pre-release and fully playable, although it's missing some functionalities (please see release v0.1 for more details.

This is the current homepage:

Then, difficulty selection page:
![difficultyPage](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/473bd77b-e947-4138-add5-0bf7cbc6afdb)
Finally, the game page:
![gamePage](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8080faac-1cda-480e-a577-8ad94856bf75)

I would appreciate any further suggestions of features or anything that might come in handy.

Thanks,
Bruno
